# 3.2.0    Profiles

> Every {{person}} in {{Lamplight}} has their own profile. 

Every individual and every organisation has a profile. This holds all the information that relates to that {{person}}. To see the profile for a particular {{person}}, start typing their name in the search box on the top right hand corner of your screen, when they appear on the drop-down list, click their name.

Your system administrator can add tabs that you see, and the information on them. These can vary depending on whether you are looking at a profile for a {{user}}, member of {{staff}} etc, or whether they are an individual, a family, or an organisation. They can also vary for different {{project}}s (see section [18.3.0  System Administration - Custom profile tabs and fields for {{people}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.3.0) for information about setting up tabs and fields, and section [3.7.0  {{Project}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/3.7.0) for more about {{project}}s).
