# 9.1.5    Recurring {{work}} records

> Recurring {{work}} records enable you to add many regular {{work}} records in one go 

On the 'when and 'where' tab within a {{work}} record, you have the option to create a recurring {{work}} record in a variety of ways.

You can: 

  * initially decide the time frame; daily, weekdays, weekly, monthly, yearly or a create a custom option. If you select an option based on days or weeks, you can then choose on which days and specify how long the recurrence will last until. Please note that the **Time and date from and to** options above should state the times of the **first** record in the series.
  * if you select a 'monthly' option, the system will recognise what day the first record in the series will be (based on the time and date information entered) and will allow monthly options to be selected
  * if you select yearly you have the option to select future years 
  * if the custom option is selected you can add irregular records. Select the second date from the drop-down option or the calendar navigation button and click to 'add'. The date will be shown; continue to add more as required.

Once a recurring record has been created, you can edit or delete all records in a series. Go to {{work}} -> view -> {{work}}, find one of the records in the series, and open the context menu for that record (right-click or click the menu button). Hold your mouse over the 'Edit' option and select 'all recurring records in series', or over Delete -> 'all recurring records in series' as required. Please note, if you just click to 'edit' or select an 'edit' button, you'll just be editing a single record in the series, not all of them. Once you do edit a single record in the series, it will be removed from the series (to prevent later data conflicts), so that if you later choose to edit all records in the series, the one you've changed will not then change.
