# 3.7.0    {{Project}}s

> A {{project}} in {{Lamplight}} is like a completely separate {{Lamplight}} system, keeping data separate, but still letting people with the correct access rights run consolidated {{report}}s across all {{project}}s. 

In {{Lamplight}}, a {{Project}} is a self-contained system within the overall one. By default, the information within one {{project}} is not visible to other {{project}}s, and the settings for one {{project}} may be completely different too. So you may choose to have several {{project}}s because:

  1. you need to keep the data separate, for confidentiality reasons, and/or
  2. you have very different services that need completely different settings, and it will be easier for your {{staff}} if these are only visible for the relevant service.

Although the data are kept separate, they are in a single database, and so senior managers can generate single {{report}}s covering some or all {{project}}s. 

It is also possible, if you wish to, to share certain data between {{project}}s: see [24.6.0  {{Project}} sharing](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/24.6.0) for more information on {{project}} sharing.
