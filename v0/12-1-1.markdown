# 12.1.1    {{Comm}} type

> You can create letters, mailing labels, emails, and sms text messages. 

Select the type of {{comm}} you wish to create, and if you have the {{comm}}s module you should also add a brief summary of the {{comm}}. This text will be displayed in lists and summaries of {{comm}}s.

SMS text messaging is available as a separate service; you will need to purchase credits in advance in order to send messages.
