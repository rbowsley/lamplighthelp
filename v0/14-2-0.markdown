When you have added all the {{people}} you want in your {{group}}, click the 'save' button in the bottom-right.

**{{Group}} name tab**: the name and description of the {{group}} are to help you and other users of the system remember what this {{group}} is for. Both are required fields.

**{{Group}} members tab: **In the search box start typing the name of the {{person}} you wish to include in your {{group}}. A drop down-box will appear showing all matches: select the {{person}} you wish to include.

Their name will be added to the table. To remove someone from the list, click the 'delete' button in the right-hand column of the table: you will be asked if you are sure. If you are, click 'OK' and they will be removed from the table and the {{group}}.

You can also add a {{person}} to a {{manual group}} from within their profile. Go the {{Group}}s Tab on their profile and click the add button on the right hand side, you'll get a list of current {{manual group}}s - tick or untick to add or remove.
