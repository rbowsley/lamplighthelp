# 22.3.0    Cost data linked to {{Staff}} Management Module.

> The Costing Module can be linked to the {{Staff}} Management Module to allow the {{staff}} cost connected to a {{work}} record to be calculated. 

Within the {{staff}} management module, hourly wages for different members of staff can be entered into the contract details tab within their profile. This information is then used when a {{work}} record is created so that the total staff cost involved in running the piece of {{work}} is calculated.

The calculation will be automatic, provided that:

  * the {{staff}} members hourly wage has been entered into their profile, and that the contract period covers the date of the {{work}} record.
  * The {{staff}} member has been added to the attendance list
  * the {{staff}} members attendance type is 'Attended' and their role is 'staff'

The {{staff}} hierarchy works in connection with authorisation levels with expenses. It means that you are only able to authorise/pay expenses for people that you manage. Your system administrator will have organised the hierarchy that exists within your system. Please speak with them if you are uncertain about this.
