It sounds like you've found a javascript bug, for which we apologise. To reset things so you can carry on working, refresh the page (press F5 on the keyboard or the refresh button on your browser).

It would be really helpful if you could let us know if this happens, with as much detail as you can about what you were doing at the time. Please email us at [enquiries@lamplightdb.co.uk](mailto:enquiries@lamplightdb.co.uk) or call 020 7558 8793.
