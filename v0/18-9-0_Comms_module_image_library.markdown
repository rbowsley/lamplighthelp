# 18.9.0    {{Comm}}s module image library

> The image library stores images you may wish to use repeatedly (such as logos) in {{comm}}s. 

Current items in the library are displayed in a series of panels. The images displayed here are thumbnails; the original image is stored in the system and the originals are what are used in {{comm}}s. These are the images that will appear on the drop-down menu in the text editor when creating {{comm}}s.

To add an image, click 'Add library item'. A popup window will appear: give the image a meaningful name, and select the image on your computer that you wish to upload and use. Click the 'save' button to add it to the library.

To remove an image from the library, click the small red 'x'.
