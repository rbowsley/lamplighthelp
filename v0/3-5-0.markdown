# 3.5.0    {{Group}}s

> {{Group}}s in {{Lamplight}} are collections of people and/or organisations. There are various ways of setting them up, and once you've done so, provide a number of powerful additional features to {{Lamplight}}. 

{{Group}}s are collections of {{people}}. Each {{person}} can belong to any number of {{group}}s.

You can use {{group}}s to:

  * develop complex, custom searches
  * speed up data entry - instead of entering each person individually into a new {{work}} record, just type in the {{group}} name and they'll all be added (see section [9.1.2  Adding attendance details to a {{work}} record](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.2) )
  * communicate - you can create mail merges for all the members of a {{group}} (see section [12.1.0  Creating a {{comm}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/12.1.0) )
  * {{report}} - groups can be used as filters in {{report}}s, so you can focus in your {{report}}ing when you need to (see section [17.1.1  {{Report}} filters](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.1) )
  * summarize data - {{group}} data views lets you see any combination of data for the members of a {{group}} (see section [14.8.0  {{Group}} data views](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.0) ).

See section [14.0.0  Introduction to {{group}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.0.0) for more on creating and using {{group}}s.
