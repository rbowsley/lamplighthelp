# 14.8.2    View {{group}} members using {{group}} data views

> To view more information about the members of a {{group}}, you can set up '{{group}} data views' (see section [14.8.0  {{Group}} data views](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.0) ) . To use a {{group}} data view, right-click on the {{group}}, hover over 'view full details' and choose the data view to use. 

To view more information about the members of a {{group}}, you can set up '{{group}} data views' (see section [14.8.0  {{Group}} data views](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.0) ). Once you have set these up, you can use them to view any {{group}}. To do so, right-click on the {{group}} you wish to view, and the 'View full details' menu option will list a sub-menu showing the data views you have set up:

![Viewing members of a {{group}}]({{imgpath}}110a.png)

Click on the data view you wish to use.

In a similar way {{group}} data views can be used with a {{work}} record: the {{people}} attending will be listed along with the extra columns from the {{group}} data view. Go to {{work}} -> view -> {{work}} and right-click or use the menu button on one of the rows of the table. The 'view full details' menu item has a sub-menu, listing all your {{group}} data views. Click on one of these and the usual popup window will open, but with the extra information in the table of attendees.
