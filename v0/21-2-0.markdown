# 21.2.0    Viewing library items

> To view library items, go to Admin > library 

A list of all the library items will be shown, organised by category.

To organise them differently, or search for a specific item. Click on the collapse toolbar option on the right hand side to show or hide a group of items.

Choose from the buttons available to group the items differently, to expand or collapse the items or to search.

To search for an item, ensure all groups are open, by clicking 'expand all' and start to type your search word. Only the groups that have an item matching your search criteria will remain open.
