# 19.7.0    {{Auto group}}s - same idea but creating them is a bit different

> {{Auto group}}s are similar in version 3 of {{Lamplight}} - they are 'saved searches' of the database. Each time you use the {{group}} it re-runs the search, so you know it still includes the right {{people}}. 

There are some changes in the way you set them up, though. You can still search by {{user}} characteristic (e.g. address, gender etc) but the system automatically adds every field into the options.

Searching by {{work}} records is similar, but we've changed the way the dates are specified. You can also now include {{outcome}}s in your {{auto group}}s too, adding even more power.

Section [14.1.0  Creating an {{auto group}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.1.0) has more details. This change is much more flexible, but may take a bit of getting used to.
