# 17.7.0    {{Staff}} timesheet {{report}}

> {{Staff}} timesheet {{report}}s provide a summary and breakdown of how {{staff}} time is spent, captured through the {{Staff}} Management Module 

Information is taken from each {{staff}} timesheet, which in turn is taken from the {{work}} records they've attended, plus contract details, non-contact work, appraisal, training and absences records. 

To run a {{staff}} timesheet {{report}}, on the main menu go to {{report}}s -> more -> {{staff}} timesheet {{report}} 

![{{Staff}} timesheet {{report}} results]({{imgpath}}184a.png)

The {{report}} presentation tab allows you to select how you wish to view the {{report}} data. Once the selection has been made, click 'run {{report}}' in the bottom right hand corner. 

If you wish to show timesheets combined across all {{project}}s, the system administrator can, via the admin menu, make this alteration. Go to admin -> system administration -> change global settings -> {{staff}} module.
