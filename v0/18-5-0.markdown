# 18.5.0    Setting up {{eval}}s

> Click on 'Add, edit and remove {{eval}} templates' on the admin menu to add/edit/remove {{eval}} forms. 

If you have not set up any {{eval}}s already, you will see the following screen: 

![Adding {{eval}}s]({{imgpath}}148a.png)

The left-hand panel lists all {{eval}}s set up in the system. The central panel shows all the questions for a particular {{eval}}. The right-hand panel shows the details for a particular question.

To start a new {{eval}}, click the 'click to add' button in the left hand panel. The central panel will show a 'blank' {{eval}}. To name it double-click where it says '{{Eval}} title'. A popup window will open:

![Starting a new {{eval}} setup]({{imgpath}}148b.png)

Enter (or edit) the name of the {{eval}}. If you have multiple {{project}}s on your system, you can also choose which {{project}}s the {{eval}} will be available to (of those that you have access to). Click the 'save' button in the bottom right. The pop-up window will close and the panels update.

Next, you need to add some questions to the {{eval}}. Make sure your {{eval}} is selected (by clicking the name in the left-hand panel if needed). Click the 'click to add' button in the central panel to add a question. The right-hand panel will now show the details for a blank question.

To add the question details, double click where it says 'Question: click to add'. Another popup window will appear:

![Adding an {{eval}} question]({{imgpath}}148c.png)

Enter the question text, question type, and again if relevant, which {{project}}s this question will be available to. By setting the {{project}}s in this way you can set up core {{eval}}s that can be used across several {{project}}s, but with some variation in questions if needed. Click the 'save' button in the bottom right hand corner. The right-hand panel will now update itself.

If you chose a 'select' or 'multi-select' question type, you can now add the options that will appear in the drop-down list for that question. Double-click the 'click to add' button and a popup window will appear asking for the text for that option.

Repeat this process, adding questions and {{eval}}s as needed. You can also edit existing {{eval}}s, questions, or options, by double-clicking in the same way as when you add them.

To re-order the questions in a particular {{eval}}, you just drag and drop them to where you want them. Click and hold the left mouse button on the question box you want to move, and move it to where you want it. Let go of the mouse button to save the new order. You can also do this with options in select-boxes.

Your {{eval}}s are saved. To be able to complete responses you will need to refresh the web-page, by clicking the 'refresh' button in your browser or pressing F5 on the keyboard.

If you edit the wording of a question or option, this will change the wording **for all {{eval}} responses already entered.** This means you should only edit questions or options to correct typos or to clarify. If you change the meaning of a question or option, all the {{eval}} responses you have already entered will change.

To delete an {{eval}}, question, or option, click the 'Del' button to the right of the button. Responses entered for a particular {{eval}}, question or option will not be lost; but it will not be visible when entering new responses.
