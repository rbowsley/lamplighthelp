# 9.2.7    Close {{linked case}}

> When the '{{linked case}}' is complete - the issue has been resolved, perhaps - mark it as closed. You cannot add new records to a closed {{linked case}}. 

To close a {{linked case}}, click 'close {{linked case}}' in the context menu. See section [13.1.0  Overview of {{linked case}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/13.1.0) for more about open and closed {{linked case}}s.

If a record is not linked to a {{linked case}}, or if the {{linked case}} is already closed, you cannot open it, and the option will be disabled.
