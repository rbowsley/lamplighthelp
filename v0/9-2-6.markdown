# 9.2.6    Remove link to {{linked case}}

> Records can be 'unlinked' from a {{linked case}} by removing them from the {{linked case}}. The record is not deleted. 

To remove the link between a {{work}} record and a {{linked case}}, click 'remove link to {{linked case}}' in the context menu.

If a record is not linked to a {{linked case}}, or if the {{linked case}} is closed, you cannot remove the link, and the option will be disabled.
