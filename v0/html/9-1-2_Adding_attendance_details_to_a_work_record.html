<h1>9.1.2    Adding attendance details to a {{work}} record</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The attendance tab stores who was at the piece of {{work}}. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The attendance tab records details of everyone at the piece of {{work}}. As well as {{user}}s, this can include {{staff}} or other contacts. If you are entering details in advance, it can include people who have booked. It can even include details of people who were expected to attend but did not for some reason.</p>

<p>Initially you will see your name as a member of {{staff}} in the list: </p>

<p>To add additional {{people}}, start typing their name in the box. When you have typed three letters, a drop-down menu will appear showing all matches: select the name you are looking for. They will be added to the table.</p>

<p>You can also add members of a {{group}} in bulk: start typing the name of the {{group}} in the search box and you will see matching {{group}}s too (preceded by the word '{{Group}}'). If you click on a {{group}} the system will add everyone in the {{group}} to the table.</p>

<p>To alter the attendance type or role for a particular person, click on the table cell and a drop-down box will appear. Select the appropriate option. Your system administrator can add options to these lists (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.0">18.2.0  System Administration - Lists</a>).</p>

<p>There is also the option to add any further notes concerning the attendees. Click in the notes box along from their name to add further detail.</p>

<p>To remove someone added in error, click the delete box - the right-hand table cell of the row you wish to delete. This will check and then remove them only from the table, not the database.</p>

<p>You can also add the number of people that attended who are unknown to you: a large public event, for example. Just add the number of people in the final field 'Number of unknown attendees'. </p>
