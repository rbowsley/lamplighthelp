<p>An attendee payee rule is very simple: the person or organisation listed on the {{work}} record pays. All you need to do is specify the amount: this can be a percentage or a fixed amount (in £s). </p>

<p>If you specify a percentage, this will be a percentage of the remaining amount to be paid. As a simple example, you might set up a rule that has a rate of 100%, and then create a payee policy containing just this rule. This will mean that the {{person}} attending will pay the full amount as calculated by the charge policy used. </p>

<p>However, if you have a payee policy with a rule that allocates 25% to another organisation (a funder, for example), and then the 'attendee pays 100%' rule, the attendee will be charged 100% of the outstanding amount - that is, 75% of the total amount - as 25% has already been charged to the funder. In other words, you can't create payments due for more than the amount charged. </p>

<p>It is possible, however, to create policies that do not allocate the full charge. An attendee payee rule of 50% as the only rule in a policy will mean that only 50% of the charges calculated are allocated. To avoid this, you might want to create an 'attendee pays 100%' rule that is added as the last rule in all policies, to ensure that any 'underbilling' is allocated to the person attending. </p>

<p>When you are finished click 'save' in the bottom right hand corner. You will return to the charge module admin menu. </p>
