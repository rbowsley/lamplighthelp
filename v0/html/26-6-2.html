<p>To create invoices, select some or all of the items in the table by ticking the checkbox in the left-hand column. You can select-all by clicking the header at the top of the table. At the base of the table, click the 'create invoices' button. You will then see a form allowing you to set certain information for the invoice: what you add here will appear on every invoice created. When you are ready, click the 'save' button in the bottom-right hand corner. You will then see a confirmation message, and be able to download a .csv file containing this invoice information, ready to import into your accounting software. See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.7.1">26.7.1  Transferring data to Sage</a> for help on importing into Sage, and section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.7.2">26.7.2  Transferring data to QuickBooks</a> for help importing into Quickbooks.
