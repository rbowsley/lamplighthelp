<h1>18.8.0    {{Comm}} templates</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Comm}}s templates are available with the {{Comm}}s module. Templates are pre-formatted letter or email templates that enable you to create form letter {{comm}}s quickly and easily. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as saving you time, {{comm}} templates also make it easier to maintain a consistent look to your {{comm}}s. Examples of templates you may wish to set up are letterheads and email signatures. But you can also include mail merge fields, so you could also set up standard letters that you send frequently. You can also include one template in another template, so for example you only need to create a letterhead template once and can then re-use it in several different templates.</p>

<p>To add or edit a template, go to the admin main menu and click 'Add, edit and remove {{comm}} templates'. You will see a table with the currently available templates:</p>

<p>This table might be quite big if you have longer letters set up. </p>
