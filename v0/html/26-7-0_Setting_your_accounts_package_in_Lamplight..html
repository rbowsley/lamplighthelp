<p>To set your accounts package in {{Lamplight}}, go to admin -> system administration -> change global settings. Go to the 'charge module' tab and select the accounts package you use. Click 'save'. </p>

<p>You need to tell {{Lamplight}} what accounts package you use, so that it can create the right kind of file for exporting invoice details. We plan to add more in the future - please let us know if you use different accounts software. We're particularly keen to add support for systems that do not require a manual export/import process involving third party software (as Sage and Quickbooks both do). We plan to add support for Kashflow soon. </p>
