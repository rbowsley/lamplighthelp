<h1>24.6.3    {{Project}} sharing - sharing {{work}} etc. records</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Work}}, {{outcome}}, {{referral}} etc records can be shared with other {{project}}s </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have {{project}} sharing enabled, then when adding a new {{work}} record you will see an additional drop-down box: 'Share this record with other{{project}}s'. You will have to select something from this drop-down, but the second option is always 'No sharing'. Other policies set up by your system administrator will appear below this: please check directly with them if you are unsure about which to use. Continue adding your {{work}} record details as usual.</p>

<p>When you view a {{work}} record, you'll see a 'sharing' section near the bottom, which if it's not being shared will look a bit like this:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}235a.png" alt="{{work}} {{project}} sharing - no sharing" /></p>

<p>If a record is being shared, it will look more like this:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}235b.png" alt="{{work}} {{project}} sharing - sharing" /></p>

<p>This explains the effect of the sharing policy - what and with whom it is being shared. To change this, you will need to edit the {{work}} record and select a different option in the sharing drop-down.</p>

<p>If you share a {{work}} record, but have not shared the profiles of the {{people}} attending, then when someone views the {{work}} record in another {{project}}, they will not see the names of the {{people}} - just blank rows. However, if you have shared both the {{people}} and {{work}} record they will be visible, and the {{work}} record will be listed in the {{work}} tab of the profile. </p>
