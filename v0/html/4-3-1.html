<h1>4.3.1    Context Menus</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Context menus appear when you right-click on the row of a table, use the Apple key click or click the menu button on the right of a table.. These menus give you various actions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most tables have context menus. This means that if you right-click on a row of the table (Apple key-click on an Apple Mac) or click on the menu button, you will see a small menu appear. If you wish to use the menu button this will need to be enabled through the personal settings section on the admin menu. See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.12.0">18.12.0  My personal settings - customising {{Lamplight}}</a> for more on personalising {{Lamplight}}. </p>

<p>The options on this menu relate to the row that you clicked on. Some of these menu items may be light grey, which means they are disabled. </p>

<p>This is either because the option is not relevant (for example, you can't close a {{linked case}} that's already closed), or because you do not have sufficient access rights (for example, you are not allowed to delete records). </p>
