# 8.1.0    Finding {{people}}

> Use the search bar on the top right-hand corner of your screen to find a profile quickly. 

There are a number of ways to find a particular {{person}}. The easiest way is to use the search bar in the top-right corner of your screen. As you start typing, the system will search the database for {{people}} with similar names (the search only starts after you've typed 3 letters). You can also search by the id number of the {{person}} or by email address. As the system finds matches, you will see a drop-down list:

![Search as you type drop-down]({{imgpath}}508a.png)

Click on their name to view their profile. If you continue typing the system will keep searching, so if you don't see the {{person}} you're searching for initially, keep typing. 

Each {{person}} has a unique profile id number. This is displayed clearly on their profile if you keep profiles anonymous. If you save a {{person}} under their name, their id number can be found within their profile by hovering the mouse over the text **Profile for ...**. When searching for a {{person}} by their ID number, you will need to make sure it is 3 digits long by adding zeros to the start of the number (e.g. to find person 23, type 023 into the search box). Email addresses need to be entered in full before the search can begin.

You can also search the entire system by clicking the 'Go' button - see section [4.2.0  Menu Search Bar](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/4.2.0).
