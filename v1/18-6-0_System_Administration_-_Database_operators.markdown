# 18.6.0    System Administration - Database operators

> Database operators are the people that have access to {{Lamplight}}. To make changes, click on 'Admin' on the main menu, and then 'Add, edit and remove database operators'. Only 'admin' operators will have access to this screen. 

You will see the following screen, listing current operators and their details.

The context menu for this table allows you to add, edit or delete database operators. Right click on a row on the table to see the menu.

See section [18.6.1  System Administration - Adding a new database operator](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.6.1) for more help on creating database operators. If an operator forgets their password, they can request a new one from the login page. Alternatively, you can reset it for them here, and {{Lamplight}} will tell you the new password.
