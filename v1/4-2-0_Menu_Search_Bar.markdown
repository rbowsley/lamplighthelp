# 4.2.0    Menu Search Bar

> The search bar in the top right-hand corner of each screen lets you search in three ways - search as you type to find {{people}}, a full search of the whole database or the option to search the help manual. 

In the top right-hand corner of each screen there is a search box. If you start typing into the search box a drop-down will appear listing the {{people}} that match what you are typing. See section [8.1.0  Finding {{people}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.1.0) for more details.

However, if you click the 'Go' button a different search will be carried out. {{Lamplight}} will do a full-text search of the entire system, looking at profiles, {{outcome}}s and {{eval}}s and present the information on a new screen. The search uses a similar approach to web searches.

Finally, if you click the 'help' button, a third search will be carried out - of the online help system. The help manual will open in a new tab on your browser. {{Lamplight}} will show you the best matches, and you can then click through to read the whole section.
