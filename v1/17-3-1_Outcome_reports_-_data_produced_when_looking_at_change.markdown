# 17.3.1    {{Outcome}} {{report}}s - data produced when looking at change

> The 'Difference between earliest and latest scores' looks at each {{person}}, and works out the difference between the earliest and latest scores in your date range. It then averages these for everyone. 

If you select 'Difference between earliest and latest scores' in the 'How to summarise the data', you will see a table similar to this:

![{{Outcome}}s {{report}}ing - difference between scores]({{imgpath}}598a.png)

The columns in this table show:

  * {{Outcome}} - the name of the particular {{outcome}}
  * Average change - the mean change across all {{people}} included in the {{report}}
  * The number of people w. change - the number of {{people}} that had some change for this {{outcome}}, based on the {{report}} filters.
  * Average positive change - the mean change for {{people}} where the later {{outcome}} was greater than the earlier (i.e. the scores increased)
  * Average negative change - the mean change for {{people}} where the later {{outcome}} was less than the earlier (i.e. the scores decreased) 
  * Maximum change - the largest change recorded
 * Minimum change - the smallest change recorded
  * Standard deviation (SD) - calculated over all changes. This figure gives an indication of how 'different' the data are from one another. For example, if the average change was 3, and in fact everyone had a difference of 3, the SD would be 0. If on the other hand one person had a difference of 2, and the other a difference of 4, the SD would be 1. In general, a Standard Deviation near 0 means that the change is similar for everyone. As the SD gets larger, the {{outcome}}s for some people are changing more than for others
 * Average days for 1 point change - tells you how quickly people are achieving change. A value of 10 in this column would be interpreted as 'on average, it takes 10 days to achieve a 1 point increase in {{outcome}} x'. To calculate these figures, the system looks at the length of time between the two {{outcome}} scores for each person, and calculates the score difference divided by the time difference. The mean of these ratios is then calculated separately for each {{outcome}}. If the early and late date/times are equal, data are excluded (to avoid division by zero).

There are a number of additional statistics that {{Lamplight}} calculates: right-click on the green table header to see a menu showing these additional data, and click on the ones you want to show or hide.

You can also generate an 'infographic' for a particular {{outcome}}, simply by clicking on the row of the table. This will take you down to show you some of the figures from the table, presented in a more visual manner to help you understand what they might be telling you.
