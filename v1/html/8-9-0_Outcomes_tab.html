<h1>8.9.0    {{Outcome}}s tab</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The {{outcome}}s tab shows the change you've seen over time </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Outcome}}s information for the individual or organisation are displayed on this tab. They can also be added here.</p>

<p>{{Outcome}}s can be displayed as a radar diagram, in a 'data-entry' table, and in a simple table view. The radar chart shows and lets you add new data by clicking on the chart; the 'data-entry' table shows {{outcome}}s down the side and months along the top, and lets you add new measures in bulk. </p>

<p>This shows the {{outcome}}s information for this {{person}} only. The radar diagram shows an {{outcome}} on each axis. The position and colour of the line shows the score and date it was achieved. For example, the diagram above shows the results in March (pink, mostly inner line) and June (blue line). 'Income' for this {{person}} has gone from a '3' in March to a '7' in June (a rather remarkable improvement!). In general (assuming larger numbers are 'better', which in VIP Online they are) you will hope that the shapes get gradually bigger as time goes on.</p>

<p>To add {{outcome}} scores on the radar chart, click the 'add' button in the mode section immediately to the right of the radar chart. Below the button you will see a date and {{workarea}} button, and then space to enter the scores and comment text. Choose the date and {{workarea}} (both are required) and then add the scores. You can either type the numbers, or click on the radar chart. You can also add text, and if you use the scroll bar you can add additional text about your involvement and other support they've received. </p>

<p>As you hover your mouse over the different scores on the chart, you will see additional information from the VIP toolkit, to help you remember what the different scores mean. When you are finished, click the save button below the list of scores and text that you've added. You will receive a confirmation message. </p>

<p>The 'data-entry' table is turned off by default in VIP Online - it can be enabled through the personal settings section. The table lists all the {{outcome}}s down the right, and then months along the top. You can click a single cell, or existing score, to add or edit an {{outcome}}. The right-most column lets you add several {{outcome}}s at once; enter the scores, and then at the bottom of the table set the date and {{workarea}} and click to save.</p>

<p>The table view shows the date of the {{outcome}}, a summary of the result, and the {{linked case}}s it is attached to are displayed in the table.</p>

<p>The order in which the records are displayed can be changed by clicking on the column headings. The default setting for viewing outcomes is 5 to a page but more or less can be viewed at once by choosing an option from the select box. Alternatively you can use the numbers to move through the records.</p>

<p>To add new outcomes click on the Add button on the right hand side of the screen.</p>

<ul>

<li>Delete - removes the {{outcome}} from the system for that user.

<ul>

</ul></li>

<li>Close {{linked case}} - flags the {{linked case}} as closed</li>

</ul>
