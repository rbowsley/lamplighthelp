# 5.0.0    People and Profiles

> Every {{person}} in {{Lamplight}} has their own profile. A profile is a way of bringing together all information about a person in one place.

Every individual and every organisation has a profile. This holds all the information that relates to that {{person}}. To see the profile for a particular {{person}}, start typing their name in the search box on the top right hand corner of your screen, when they appear on the drop-down list, click their name.  You can search by name, postcode, Lamplight ID number, email and date of birth.

Every system will have different tabs, though almost all will start with the Contact Details tab.  The first tabs will normally contain demographic information or information about people, and the later ones information on the activities you do with them.

Your system administrator can add tabs that you see, and the information on them. These can vary depending on whether you are looking at a profile for a {{user}}, member of {{staff}} etc, or whether they are an individual, a family, or an organisation. They can also vary for different {{project}}s (see section [18.3.0  System Administration - Custom profile tabs and fields for {{people}}](/help/index/p/18.3.0) for information about setting up tabs and fields, and section [3.7.0  {{Project}}s](/help/index/p/3.7.0) for more about {{project}}s).
