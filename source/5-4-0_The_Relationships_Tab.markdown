# 5.4.0    The Relationships Tab

> Relationships link different {{people}} in {{Lamplight}}. 

The new {{person}} may have any number of relationships to other {{people}} on the database. These are added to the profile in the relationships tab. 

For example, you may wish to record which people work with a new {{user}} regularly, who their doctor is, their key worker, social worker, parole officer and other members of the family on the database. You can record as many relationship as you like here.

**Add a relationship**

To add a new relationship, click add on the right hand side of the screen.

A small pop up window will appear. Begin typing the name of the {{person}} to whom your {{person}} is related in the search box. The live search will display the names of the {{people}} on the database who match the name you are typing. Select the name of the {{person}} from the list that appears.

Below the search box, select the relationship in which they stand to the new user or organisation (e.g. trustee, employer, key worker, my {{user}} - for more information about My {{User}}s see section [7.2.0  My {{User}}s](/help/index/p/7.2.0)).

The final option is to select whether you wish this {{person}} to be the default contact for the {{person}}'s profile you are currently in. This may be appropriate if you want to write to an organisation, but address and send it to the manager's personal email account.

Below this there is a notes box where you can record any other details that you would like to be shown about this {{person}} in the relationships table. 

Once the relationship has been saved the table in the tab will be updated. You can then use the context menu from the table for further actions.

You can:

  * move into the linked {{person}}s profile by clicking 'view full details'
  * Edit or delete the relationship link (if you have the appropriate access level)
  * move directly into a {{comm}} record to communicate with linked {{person}} (not with the {{person}} whose profile you are in)
  * copy address details from the linked {{person}} - useful if they live/work at the same address, it will copy it automatically and update the contact details tab immediately.

Below the relationships table, on the right hand side of the screen next to the 'Add' button, there is a 'View History' button. If you click on this you will see all the {{people}} who have ever been shown as having a relationship with the {{person}} in this profile.  The 'Since' column will show you when the relationship was started, and the 'To' column when that relationship was closed.  Click the 'View current' button on the right to return to the normal view.
