### Script

Previously when you edited custom tabs and fields in system administration, the page would look like this. 
It was divided up into three sections – one showing the tabs, the next the fields in that tab, and the final one the options in a field. 
Opening the same page in system administration will now look like this.  

You will see a list of all your different tabs.  You can see what fields are in each tab by clicking on its name or on the ‘more information’ button to the right of it. Similarly, you can see what options are in each field by clicking on the field name, or that field’s own ‘more information’ button.  

#### Adding a New Tab  

To add a single tab to your system,  click on the ‘add new tab’ button at the top of the list. This opens a box where you will fill in the tab name, and choose whether it is for people, organisations or families on your system, and then the roles. On this system we have clients, staff and volunteers, contacts and organisations, but you may see different roles on yours. Whatever you see here, your choices will determine which profiles the tab appears on. If you have a multi-{{project}} system, you can also choose here which {{project}}s the tab will show in.  

Once you have added all the information, click ‘update’. It is important to remember that although the tab will now be added to the list, nothing is finally saved until you click on ‘save all changes’ at the top or bottom of the page, so do remember to do this before you navigate away.  

You can also add several tabs to your system at the same time by choosing the ‘bulk add tab’ option. When you do this, you will first be asked to enter the names for each of them separated by a semi-colon. Once you have added these, you will need to find them in the list and click ‘edit’ to add details to them – this will include information on the type of profile and roles that the tab will appear on, and which {{project}}s it is visible to. 

#### Adding Fields to a Tab  

Once you have a new tab you will want to add fields to it. First click on it in the list, and you will see the ‘click add new field to get started’ box. In this form you’ll need to give the field a name, then fill in the other details. For more information on how to do this, and what the different fields will look like in your system, please see section 16.7.1 of our help manual. Once you’ve made all your choices, click ‘update’.  

It is also possible to add several fields at the same to time. To do this, click on the ‘bulk add field’ button below the tab name.  This opens a text box where you can enter each of your field names, separated by a semi-colon. Once you have typed them all in, press ‘add all’. You will now need to find each one in the list and click edit to add the detail to it.  

#### Adding Options to a Fields  

You may have added a field type which requires options, for example a select box or radio buttons. Find your field in the list, and if you can’t see the options buttons, click either on the name or the ‘see more’ button to the right of it. 
If you want to add one option at a time, choose the ‘add new option’ button. This will open a text box where you add the text of your option. Click ‘update’ when you’re done.  

If you want to add several options in one go, click on ‘bulk add option’. Now you can enter the text for several options in your field, each one separated by a semi colon.  

There is another button here called ‘add from built-in list’. Clicking here will open a choice of pre-entered lists, such as gender, sexual orientation, religion, days and numbers. If you would like to use any of these, click in the circle to the left of it, then choose ‘add’ at the bottom of the screen. If one of them has some of the options that you need but not all of them, or you would need to change some of them, you can choose to add them but then edit them afterwards. If none of them meet your needs, just click on ‘cancel’ to close them.   

#### Editing Tabs, Fields and Options  

Each tab, field and option has a set of buttons to the right of it. If need to edit one of them just find the relevant item in the list and click on the pen and paper icon to the right of it. If it’s a field or option which isn’t currently showing in the list, click on the name of the tab or field so that the options underneath become visible. Alternatively, you can click on the ‘show more’ button to the right of the tab or field name to open it up.  

#### Changing the Order of Tabs, Fields and Options in the List

You can move your tabs up and down the list, as well as reordering the fields in each tab, or the options in the field. 
To do this, find the item that you would like to move. To the right you will see up and down arrows. Click on these until you have the item where you need it to be.  

Alternatively, above each list of tabs, fields or options there is a ‘sort’ button. If you click this once it will sort the items in alphabetical order. Click twice and it will reverse the order.  

#### Deleting Tabs, Fields and Options  

Before deleting existing tabs and fields, please see section 16.7.2 of our help pages which explain the consequences of this in more detail.  

There is a delete button to the right of each row. If you choose to delete a tab it will then also remove any fields and options under it. If you delete a field then the options below it will also be removed. Deleting an option only eliminates that single item. 
When you choose to ‘delete’ an item it will turn red in the list. If you did this by mistake then press the ‘delete’ button again to return it to normal. The item will not be permanently deleted until you press the ‘save all changes’ button at the top or bottom of the page. Once you have done this then you can’t change your mind again.  

When you’ve made all the changes that you need, remember to click the ‘save all changes’ button at the top or bottom of the page before leaving. If you don’t do this then all your changes will be lost.  

If you’d like to know more details, please see section 16.7 of our help pages. Thank you for watching.
