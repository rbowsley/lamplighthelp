# 14.1.0    {{Eval}} {{Report}}

> The {{eval}} {{report}} presents summaries of {{eval}} questionnaires completed. The {{report}} shows each question, with the number (or percentage) of responses for each option. 

In the '{{Report}} filters' tab there is an additional option, 'Select {{eval}}', listing the {{eval}}s available. You will need to select the relevant {{eval}} from this list.

The {{report}} will produce a series of tables, one for each question in the {{eval}}.

If {{eval}}s have been entered as linked to a particular {{person}}, it is possible to split data by background factors of those {{people}}, using the 'Column data' drop- down.

Once you have run the {{report}} initially, an extra tab will be added: '{{Eval}} filters'. This enables you to filter the {{report}} for responses to one or more questions. Select the filters you wish to use and run the {{report}} again for a smaller set of {{eval}} responses. In the example above, you may wish to see the responses for people who felt the course did not meet their expectations, to try and establish why not.

The results in the tables will now be shown just for those people that said 'no' to the first question.
