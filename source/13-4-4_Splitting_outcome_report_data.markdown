# 13.4.4    Splitting {{Outcome}} {{Report}} Data

> To explore any differences in {{outcome}} results in more detail, it is possible to split the data by background personal factors (for example, gender). 

To explore any differences in {{outcome}} results in more detail through the {{outcome}} {{report}}s, it is possible to split the data by background factors (for example, gender or organisation size). Fields available are those in use profiles that are select-boxes. If you choose something from the 'Split data' drop-down box you will see an additional column in the table after the '{{Outcome}}' table:

![{{Outcome}}s {{report}} - split results](136a.png)

It is now possible to look at differences in the impact you are having according to background factors. In the example above, you can see that 'Gender' has been selected, and that there is a considerable difference between the outcomes for men and women (but this is fictional data, of course).

It is possible that, particularly for fields with a large number of options, the number of people affected may be quite small (as in the example above). Whenever analysing data you should be careful about the conclusions drawn when the total numbers of {{people}} are small.
