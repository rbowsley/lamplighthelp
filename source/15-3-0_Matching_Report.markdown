# 15.3.0 <i class="fa fa-chart-line"></i>  {{Volunteering opportunity}} and {{Volunteering application}} {{Report}}s

> You can create {{report}}s from information entered in the Matching Module. This will show you the numbers of {{volunteering opportunity}} records, the number of {{volunteering application}} records, and how many have been matched.


You will see in the {{report}}s submenu two {{report}}s for the Matching Module: a {{volunteering opportunity}} and a {{volunteering application}} {{report}}.  These are very similar and both are covered below.

### Running the {{report}}

Go to {{report}}s > more... > {{volunteering opportunity}}.  You will see the [standard {{report}} filters](/help/index/p/14.1.1) and [{{report}} presentation](/help/index/p/14.1.4) tabs.  Change any filters or presentation options you require, and click 'run report'.

The {{volunteering opportunity}} {{report}} will give you a table similar to this:

![{{Volunteering opportunity}} sample {{report}}](15.3a.png)

A single {{opportunity provider}} may have several {{volunteering opportunity}} records; this is the difference between the first two data columns.  Similarly, one {{volunteering applicant}} may have many {{volunteering application}} records: this explains the difference between the last two columns.

The {{volunteering application}} {{report}} will give a table similar to this:

![{{Volunteering application}} sample {{report}}](15.3b.png)

It gives similar data but from the side of {{volunteering application}} records.


You can create [{{report}} templates (sect 14.1.6)](/help/index/p/14.1.6) for both of these {{report}}s word if needed.
