# 11.0.0    {{Group}}s

> {{Group}}s in {{Lamplight}} are collections of {{people}} or organisations. You can create different types of {{group}}: automatic, manual or merge. You can use information from profiles or activity records to filter your group members.

A {{group}} is a collection of {{people}} or organisations. You can set up any number of {{group}}s, and each {{person}} in your database can belong to lots of {{group}}s. For example, you may set up the following {{group}}s:

  * steering {{group}} members
  * {{user}}s in N1
  * new {{user}}s in Q2 and Q3 2013
  * all youth {{work}} {{staff}}
  * organisations working with children

You can use {{group}}s in different ways:

  * bulk data entry. If you have a regular {{group}} of {{user}}s that comes to a particular session every week, instead of adding them individually each time you can create a {{group}}. All you need to do then is search for the group in the attendance tab of your work record and select it. {{Lamplight}} will automatically add everyone that's in the {{group}} to the attendance table in the {{work}} record (see section [9.1.2  Adding attendance details to a {{work}} record](/help/index//p/9.1.2) ). You can do the same for {{outcome}}s and {{comm}}s records.
  * {{Report}} filters. Rather than running a {{report}} for everyone on the system, {{group}}s can be used to filter the data included in the {{report}} (see section [17.1.1  {{Report}} filters](/help/index/p/17.1.1) ) to provide a report on a specific set of people. 
  * {{Group}} data views. You can use {{group}}s to view detailed information about members of the group (see section [xx.xx.xx {{Group}} data views](/help/index/p/xx.x.x) ).

There are three types of {{group}}s: {{manual group}}s, {{auto group}}s, and {{merge group}}s. 
  * {{Manual group}}s are created by selecting the specific {{people}} or organisations that you want to include. Similar to a written list of names, the {{group}} won't change unless someone manually updates the list.
  * {{Auto group}}s are like saved searches: you enter the criteria (e.g. 'postcode starts with N1') and {{Lamplight}} searches for everyone that meets those criteria. Each time you use the {{group}} {{Lamplight}} will automatically check again, so if someone moves out of the area and you update the postcode, that person will no longer be in the {{group}} without you having to change anything else. 
  * {{Merge group}}s are created by joining existing {{auto group}}s or {{manual group}}s together - {{Lamplight}} will take all the members of each of the {{group}}s you specify and combine them into one, removing any duplicates.
