A body type rule will allocate an amount to be paid based on the 'type' of the person or organisation listed. 'Type' here means person, organisation or family. This type of rule is going to make sense if you add {{people}} to {{work}} records using their relationships to others. For example, if Matt Parker is linked (through relationships) to Lamplight Database Systems as an employee, then you can add 'Matt Parker, Lamplight Database Systems' to the {{work}} record, instead of just 'Matt Parker' or 'Lamplight Database Systems'. In this example you will most likely want to send the bill to Lamplight Database Systems, rather than Matt Parker personally. By using a body-type payee rule set to 'organisation', you can ensure that it is the organisation that pays. 

This does mean that you need to make sure that you add organisations to the {{work}} record, not just the individual. If the organisation is not stated, {{Lamplight}} will not be able to allocate the amount to pay. 

When you are finished click 'save' in the bottom right hand corner. You will return to the charge module admin menu.
