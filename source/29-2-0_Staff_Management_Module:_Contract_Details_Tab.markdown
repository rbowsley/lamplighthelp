# 29.2.0 {{Staff}} Management Module: Contract Details Tab

> Contract detail information is used by the timesheet system in its calculations. 

The information entered into this tab forms the basis for the calculations that are used for the timesheet and the annual leave summary.

To enter information click on the Add button, found on the right hand side within the Contract details tab of a {{staff}} members profile. A form will open up and details can be entered. Click Save on the right hand side when complete.

{{Staff}} may only have one contract open at any time, so if you add a new contract record an existing one that's still open will be 'closed' - the date to will be set automatically.
