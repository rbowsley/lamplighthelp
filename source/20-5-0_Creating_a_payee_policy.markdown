You will see a screen similar to the one above. You need to give the policy a name - this is what you will see day-to-day on your {{work}} records, so it needs to be clear from the name which policy should be used (if you're going to have more than one policy, that is). 

The section on the right of the screen shows all the payee rules you have created, and in the centre a space to add the rules you need. To add a rule to the policy, simply click and hold the mouse button on the rule, drag it to the centre, and release the mouse button. The rule will appear in the central frame. You can add more rules before or after in the same way, and can remove them by dragging them from the central list to the right-hand side.

The order of the rules is important. Rules will be applied in the order that they are listed. 

When you have finished, click the 'save' button in the bottom-right hand corner and you will return to the charge module menu. Your new payee policy will be listed, and is now available to use in {{work}} records. 

To edit an existing policy, click on the name of the policy from this screen and you can move the rules around in the same way. Note that if you do edit a policy, the changes will not be applied retrospectively - payments due already calculated will remain as they are. However, if you edit a {{work}} record and keep the same policy, payees will be re-calculated when you save the record. It may be better to create a new policy in these circumstances.
