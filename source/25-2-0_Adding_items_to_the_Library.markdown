# 25.2.0    Adding Items to the Library

> To add an item directly to the library, on the admin menu, click library. 

As you enter the Library, you'll see a list of all items that have been added, and below them an 'add item' button. When you click this you'll see the form to add an item:

Complete as many field boxes as applicable. The 'Tag' box acts as a 'search as you type' box so that you can search for an existing Tag and assign new library items to it. To create a new tag, write the tag title in the box and click 'add new tag' when it has been successfully attached it will appear within the library item, as seen in the image below:

For a web link to be saved, ensure it is, for example www.lamplight3.info/, NOT https://www.lamplight3.info/

Your system administrator will have created categories to link library items to - if you need to discuss these please speak to them directly. When all details are entered, click Save.

To add a record to the library, whether it is a {{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{referral}} or a {{grant}} record, you will firstly need to locate the record you wish to add. This can either be from the diary, within a profile or via the main menu. When the record opens, click on the 'add to library' button on the top right hand corner. This transfers the record into a new library item, ready for further information to be added where necessary.
