### Script

Here at Lamplight we’ve been making a few changes to how drop-down lists work in system administration. These changes do not affect the {{group}}s you may be able to see through the main menu. They relate to system admin lists, which are used for adding options to drop-down menus, for example relationship types or {{linked case}} categories. {{Workarea}}s, {{subworkarea}}s and {{outcome}}s are also added as lists in system admin, as are custom tabs and fields, and you can find more details on these specific ones in our other videos. 

Most drop-down lists previously looked like this. The items in the current list would show in a table.

This same type of list now looks like this. You can still see the names in rows down the page. 


#### Adding New List Items

There are buttons to add new items to the list at the top. If you choose to add one item at a time, click on the ‘add new item’ box, complete the text, in this example it could be ‘Dr’, then click ‘update’ to add it to the list. If you want to add several items to your list, click the ‘bulk add item’ button, then add each new item in the text box, separated by a semi-colon. Press ‘add all’ when you have finished.

It is important to remember that while the new items show in your list, they will not have been saved to the system until you press the ‘save all changes’ button at the top or bottom of the page. 

#### Moving, Editing and Deleting List Items

To the right of each list item are some buttons. The first two of these enable you to move an item up and down the list. The pen and paper icon is the edit button, so you can re-open any item to make changes to it, and the final one is to delete. When you click this button to delete an item in your list,  the row will turn red to show that this has been done. If you change your mind you can click the ‘delete’ icon again and the row will return to normal. Once you choose to ‘save all changes’ by clicking the button at the top or bottom of the page, then you can’t reverse your decision.

There is also a ‘sort’ button above the list of items. Clicking this once will sort your list in alphabetical order. Clicking it again will sort in reverse order. Again, remember to click ‘save all changes’ before leaving the page.
If you need to know more details, you can find them in section 16.6 of our help pages. 

Thank you for watching.
