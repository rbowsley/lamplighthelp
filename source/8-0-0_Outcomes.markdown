# 8.0.0 {{Outcome}}s

> The difference your services are making over time to your {{user}}s, {{staff}} and others are entered as {{outcome}}s in Lamplight



{{Outcome}}s are the impact your work has on individuals or organisations, measured by showing changes over time. This involves scoring  the same measure two or more times so that you have a baseline starting point, and one or more subsequent scores. 

For example, your organisation may be working to improve the self-confidence of the {{people}} you work with. In January you could measure how confident John felt on a scale of 1-10, and enter it into Lamplight. A couple of months later you measure John again. Then three months after that you ask John again how confident he feels. In five months you can show how much improvement there has been in John's confidence levels. 

Collecting this type of data can be very powerful. It is possible to then {{report}} on the amount of change {{user}}s experience overall, as well as looking at how quickly change occurs, and how this varies between different groups of {{people}}. It is also possible to look at the relationship between the amount of {{work}} you have done, and the impact it has had.

{{Lamplight}} lets you collect this kind of data for your {{user}}s, whether they are {{people}}, {{family}} or {{org}}s. You can also use {{outcome}}s with {{staff}} to track their development, for example, or with partner agencies to see if you have any impact on their practices.

In some cases it will not be possible or appropriate to collect this data in this way. For example, you may run a one-off training session and ask participants to complete an evaluation form at the end of the session. In this case there is no baseline position, and you will need to be able to report '78% of participants felt that the training was valuable'. You may then compare this with previous years: **but the participants are (most likely) different people.** This is a different type of data, which in {{Lamplight}} uses the {{Eval}} module: see section [22.0.0  {{Eval}}s Module Overview](/help/index/p/22.0.0) for more details.
