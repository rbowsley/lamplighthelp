# 22.1.1 {{Eval}}s Module: Editing and Deleting {{Eval}} Templates

> Before editing or deleting {{eval}} templates, consider the effect this may have on existing data



It is possible to edit and delete existing {{eval}} templates in {{Lamplight}}, but there are some consequences to this that you will need to consider before you do so:

- If an {{eval}} is deleted, you are not deleting the data that has already been recorded for that {{eval}} type. The {{eval}} records remain and can be viewed in '{{activity}} -> view -> {{eval}}s, or in the ‘{{Eval}}s’ tab of a profile (if the {{eval}} has been linked to a profile when it was entered (for more on this see [22.2.0 Adding and Editing {{Eval}} Responses](/help/index/p/22.2.0).
- It will no longer be possible to report on the {{eval}} results or filter based on them, as there will not be the option to select that {{eval}} on the report filters page (for more on {{eval}} reporting see [15.2.0 {{Eval}} Report](/help/index/p/15.2.0)
- If a field or field option is deleted in a particular {{eval}}, although it will still be possible to run a report on that {{eval}} it will no longer be possible to use the field as a filter in reports.
- If a field option is changed, the data that has been recorded against that field to date will remain the same. For example, if an option is changed from ‘Science’ to ‘History’, all previous responses related to ‘Science’, will now relate to ‘History’. It may be more appropriate to remove an option and add a new one.

### Editing {{Eval}}s  

**Be careful:** existing data can be hidden by changing the field type (for example, if a ‘Text box’ is changed to a ‘Select box’, previous responses will no longer be visible). However, the information is retained in the system, and will be made visible again by changing the field back to its original type. If you are uncertain about this, please call Lamplight support.  

{{Eval}} templates are edited in the section of system admin as they were created in (admin -> system administration -> (in the module administration secton, {{Eval}}s Module) Manage {{eval}} templates).
- Select the {{eval}} you wish to edit in the list, then click on the pen and paper symbol to the right of it. 
- Make your changes, then click on 'Update'. (For more on the different fields in an {{eval}} or question, see [22.1.0 {{Eval}}s Module: Setting Up {{Eval}}s](help/index/p/22.1.0).)
- Remember to click 'save all changes' on the main page before navigating away - if you do not do this then any changes that you have made will be lost. 

### Deleting {{Eval}}s, Questions and Options

If you delete an {{eval}}, all of the questions in it will be deleted too. Similarly, if you delete a question, the options within that will also be erased.

To delete any {{eval}}, question or option:
 
 - Find it in the list, then click on the 'dustbin' icon to the right of it. The item you have chosen will now show as pink in the list.
 - If you've deleted in error, at this stage you can click on the dustbin icon again to reinstate the evaluation. 
 - Click 'save all changes' at the top or bottom of the page to confirm deletion.
