# 3.5.3    Resizing, moving and columns

> You can change the way a table looks by changing the size of columns, and show or hide different columns. 

All columns can be resized. On the column headers, hover over the dividing line between one column and the next. You will see the cursor change to a left-right resize icon:

Click and drag the column to change its width. 

You can also re-order columns in tables: click and hold on the column header. The cursor will change to a compass arrow and a red line will show on the table to indicate where the new column will be inserted.

You have the opportunity to choose the information you wish to view on your table and therefore select appropriate information to download if required (see section [4.3.5  Downloading tables](/help/index/p/4.3.5)). Right click over the green header strip on the table. Click to select the columns you wish to view.
