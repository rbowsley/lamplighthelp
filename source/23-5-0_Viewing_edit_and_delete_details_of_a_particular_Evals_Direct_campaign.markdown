# 23.5.0 {{Eval}} Direct: View, Edit and Delete Details of a Campaign

> To view details for a particular campaign, view all campaigns (see section [23.2.0  Viewing existing {{Eval}}s Direct campaigns](/help/index/p/23.2.0)) and then use the context menu. 

**Viewing Existing Campaigns**

Once the table appears, right click over the campaign you wish to view or use the menu button and select 'view full details'.

This will show a pop-up window with information about the campaign, and a list of invitees at the bottom. You can see here who has responded, and there is a hidden table column listing the urls (web addresses) for each person (for individual campaigns) or for the campaign as a whole. To view the urls, right-click on the column headers of the table and select 'Their URL'.

You can also download this table, which will also include the URLs, so you can if you wish do your own mail-merge to tell invitees about it and send them their particular URL.

**Editing Existing Campaigns**

To edit a particular campaign, via the context menu, click to 'Edit'. Although you'll see that some items are blanked out: to prevent data inconsistencies you cannot change the {{eval}} template, {{workarea}}, or the separate page option

In addition, for 'separate page' campaigns, you cannot remove invitees that have already responded: the red cross to delete will not be visible. When you have made the changes you want to, click the 'save' button.

**Deleting a Campaign**

To delete a particular campaign, select Delete from the context menu. You can only delete campaigns that have not had any responses. If you try and delete one that has already had some you will receive an error message if you try to delete it. If you do want to stop an existing campaign, you may edit it and change the 'date to' to the current time and date, which will prevent any more responses and respondees will see an error {{message}}.
