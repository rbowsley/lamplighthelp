28.1.0 {{Staff}} Management Module: Set-up

> Before using the {{Staff}} Management Module you will need to set up a {{staff}} hierarchy and list items which enable you to specify absence, training and other categories

You’ll need to have a System Administrator role to update the list items and organise the staff hierarchy (this governs who can see staff profiles). The list items allow you to customise the options available when adding absence, training and appraisal records.
