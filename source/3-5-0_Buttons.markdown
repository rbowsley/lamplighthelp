# 3.5.0    Buttons

> Buttons do more than click - some have menus too. 

Many screens have buttons that do particular things: usually adding or editing information (normally the top right of the page), or saving it (normally the bottom right of the page/pop-up box). Just click the button.

Another type of button is called a 'Radio button', which are used for the {{workarea}}s, in the first tab of the Work Record.  When you select a radio button (to select a {{workarea}}), you'll see another option appear to the right, where you can select a second option.  In this case, a {{workarea}}, and a {{subworkarea}} within that.  Each main radio button has it's own set of sub-options.  You can only select one {{workarea}} at a time.

You can often also make multiple selections on these buttons. For example, select a {{workarea}} and you will see the {{subworkarea}}'s appear.  You can then select multiple subwork areas, simply by clicking on multiple selections.  Some systems will be designed to make use of multiuple selections, and others not.  You can check this with your system administrator.
