# 16.9.0    Creating {{report}} templates

> A {{report}} template is a a way of saving the particular filters and display options for a {{report}},so that it can be run intstantly at any time.  

These can be useful, for example, for regular reports for funders, so that you don't need to create a new report each time.  They are set-up and operate in the same way as a normal report, (but in a different place) and can then be chosen from the appropriate report menu.

You can create {{report}} templates for each different type of {{report}}.  You do this from within the System Administration menu.  You'll need to be a System Administrator to do this.

Once created these {{report}}s are shown when you go to create a {{report}} from the main menu.  The templates you have created are shown as dropdown options, and a new option is added for a non-template report.  For example, 'Custom {{work}} report'.

To create a {{report}} template, use the 'Admin' option in the main menu, and choose 'System administration' from within the menu bar.  This will take you to the System Administration menu.  If you are a system administrator, you will see a section in the top right called '{{report}} templates.

Choose 'Add edit and remove {{report}} templates, to enter this section.  Once in this page, you will see options to add {{report}} templates for {{work}}, {{referral}}s, {{Linked case}}s, {{outcome}}s, and any of the modules you have enabled.  You'll be able to see existing templates which you can edit.  You'll also see an 'add' button at the bottom of each section.

**Completing the template**

Once you have completed the template it will save and take you back to the {{report}} templates page, without showing you the results.  For this reason we recommend you create your {{report}} normally first, to ensure it's been created correctly and is showing appropriate data, before recreating it in the {{report}} templates section.

There is an additional page when creating a template, that you do not see in the normal {{report}} process.  The first page allows you to give the {{report}} a name, and a description, so that staff will know what {{report}} they are running, and can understand what it is designed to do.  We encourage you to be as specific as possible.  You can also lock the report, so that only you can edit it.  (Although only system administrators can alter it regardless.)

The other difference when creating a {{report}} template, are the dates.  Within a template we have given you options to add dynamic rather than fixed dates.  You can choose for example to run the {{report}} from the beginning of the previous quarter, to the end of the previous quarter.  This will ensure that whenever you run the report, it will be reporting in the previous quarter.

Finally, when run, {{report}}s display the information requested in the template, but can then be altered, to break down the numbers in different ways for example.  This means that one {{report}} may be created as a template and then changed in a number of different ways, to more easily give a range of data for your reporting from a single {{report}}

**Viewing {{report}} templates**

As {{report}} templates show in the main menu, you will need to refresh the page in your browser, using the F5 key, in order to see your newly added reports in the menu.
