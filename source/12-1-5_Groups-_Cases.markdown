# 12.1.5  <i class="fa fa-users"></i> {{Auto group}}s: {{Case}}s

> The '{{Case}}s' tab is where you can search for {{people}} based on their {{case}}s, either open or closed.

The category list items (those we've shown with a red line) within the tab will be reflective of your system and settings.
As with all {{auto group}} setting, the fields act as filters, only use the settings relevant to the question you're asking.

### Name and Description

The {{case}} name and description are both text boxes within the system. These initial settings provide the opportunity to generate a {{group}} of {{profile}}s where the name and/or the description has something in common.
Enter the text you want to match in the initial box and how you want Lamplight to use the text from the drop-down that follows.

Warning. This is based on spelling in the system as it's a free text box.

### Categories

You can limit the search to specific categories selected from within the case.
Please use the Ctrl button on your keyboard to select more than one option with your mouse.

In the example below, we would create a {{group}} of all {{people}} involved in either a 1:1 Support or IMHA case, which was 'light touch' level of support.

### Dates of {{Case}}s

Dates can be used in different ways within {{case}}s, we can look at:
- opened: the date the {{case}} began and was opened/started
- closed: the date the {{case}} ended and was closed down
- open: the dates the {{case}} was open and active

For example, a {{case}} can be opened in April, open during May and closed in June. The {{auto group}} provides you the flexibility of choosing which point is important.
- It can be a single option, a {{group}} of all those opened during April

- It can be for multiple options, a {{group}} of all those opened/started at some point during the current calendar year and was closed on or before the end of the previous month and remain closed now. 

Using 'dynamic' dates in the {{group}} means that it can easily be used again, without having to edit the {{group}} settings.

### Days Open

This section allows you to create a {{group}} based on the duration of the {{case}}.

Choose from the drop-dwn list before adding in the number of days in the second box.
