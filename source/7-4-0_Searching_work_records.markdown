# 7.4.0    Searching {{Work}} Records

> The search bar at the top of the screen searches {{work}} records for the text you enter. 

If you want to search a {{work}} record using a free text search (for example, to search for text in the 'follow up' field), use the search bar found on the top right-hand corner of your screen. If you type in the text you wish to search for and click the 'Go' button, {{Lamplight}} will carry out a full-text search of the system. See section [4.2.0  Menu Search Bar](/help/index/p/4.2.0) for more information on full-text searching.
