# 16.10.0 <i class="fa fa-chart-line"></i> Creating {{Activity}} List Templates

> {{Activity}} list templates can be used to view your {{work}} and other {{activity}} records. They are similar to report templates, letting you save search criteria which are then available to use whenever you are searching your records



When you view {{activity}} records, there is a search bar above the table where you can add filters to narrow down your search, and extra columns so that you can choose to see more information.

You can create templates which save your search criteria so that you do not have to enter it each time you view your records. This is particularly useful if you frequently need to find particular information from {{activity}} records, for example on {{work}}, {{outcome}}s, or {{referral}}s (you may not use all of these in your system).

### To Create a Template
- Go to 'system administration' and in the 'Templates' section select 'Manage {{activity}} list templates'. 
- Find the section showing the type of record you want to create a template for (e.g. {{work}} or {{outcome}}s). 
- At the bottom of this section, click add.

On the next page you must give your {{activity}} list template a name and description. The name is what you will see in future in the list to choose from, so it should be short and self-explanatory.  If needed, you can choose to lock your template so that other administrators can’t change it.

The following pages are where you choose the filters for your list and any extra columns you want your table to display. Once you have all you need, click save.

This new template will now appear in a sub-menu when you go to '{{activity}} -> view' on the main menu.
