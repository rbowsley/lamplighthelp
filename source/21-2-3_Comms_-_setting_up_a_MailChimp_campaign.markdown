Follow the on-screen prompts within MailChimp to set up your newsletter.

When you get to the screen to choose which list you want to use to send out your newsletter, you need to choose the name of your saved segment, synced from your {{group}} in Lamplight.

You can send yourself and colleagues a test email to check how it looks on screen. If you want to make changes to the newsletter then you can go back in and edit it.

When you are happy that your newsletter looks the way you want it to and all of the contacts have been synced from {{Lamplight}} you can send finish sending your campaign from MailChimp.

By logging into the MailChimp site you can see statistics (number of emails opened; number of clicks, number of 'unsubscribes', number of 'bounces' (ie email addresses not recognised), number of emails uniquely opened). 
You may want to read more about these statistics from MailChimp: [understanding reports](http://mailchimp.com/resources/guides/understanding-reports/), for example, gives some explanation of what it means; what the limitations are; and what 'usual' open rates might be.
