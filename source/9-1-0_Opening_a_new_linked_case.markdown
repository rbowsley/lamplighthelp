# 9.1.0    Opening a new {{linked case}}

You can create a new {{Linked case}} either through the '{{linked case}} View' tab, or as you link a {{work}} or other record to a {{linked case}}.

**Through the '{{linked case}} View' tab.**

If you scroll down to the bottom of this tab, you'll see a section called 'Create a new {{linked Case}}'.

This will include the {{linked case}} name, (which is often the name of the {{user}}), and the date.  You may have additional options which you can choose, and which you may complete at different stages of the {{linked case}}. Complete any which are relevent.  You can also make any notes about the {{linked case}} in the '{{Linked case}} description'.

Once you have completed the details, use the save button to save the case.

**While linking a record to the case**

Using the context menu from a view of {{work}} or other records, you can choose the 'Link to {{linked case}}' option, which will create a pop-up box, the same as above.  As you type, matches to existing {{linked case}}s will be displayed, or you can enter a new {{linked case}} name, complete the details as above, and save.
